# Windows Subsystem for Linux

#### What is the Windows Subsystem for Linux? (https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/)

The Windows Subsystem for Linux lets developers run a GNU/Linux environment -- including most command-line tools, utilities, and applications -- directly on Windows, unmodified, without the overhead of a traditional virtual machine or dual-boot setup.


 # You can:

 - Choose your favorite GNU/Linux distributions from the Microsoft Store.
 
 - Run common command-line tools such as grep, sed, awk, or other ELF-64 binaries.
 
 - Run Bash shell scripts and GNU/Linux command-line applications including:
 
 - Tools: vim, emacs, tmux
 
 - Languages: NodeJS, Javascript, Python, Ruby, C/C++, C# & F#, Rust, Go, etc.
 
 - Services: SSHD, MySQL, Apache, lighttpd, MongoDB, PostgreSQL.
 
 - Install additional software using your own GNU/Linux distribution package manager.
 
 - Invoke Windows applications using a Unix-like command-line shell.
 
 - Invoke GNU/Linux applications on Windows.

# What is WSL 2?
 - WSL 2 is a new version of the Windows Subsystem for Linux architecture that powers the Windows Subsystem for Linux    to run ELF64 Linux binaries on Windows. Its primary goals are to increase file system performance, as well as        adding full system call compatibility.

 - This new architecture changes how these Linux binaries interact with Windows and your computer's hardware, but        still provides the same user experience as in WSL 1 (the current widely available version).

 - Individual Linux distributions can be run with either the WSL 1 or WSL 2 architecture. Each distribution can be      upgraded or downgraded at any time and you can run WSL 1 and WSL 2 distributions side by side. WSL 2 uses an          entirely new architecture that benefits from running a real Linux kernel.
