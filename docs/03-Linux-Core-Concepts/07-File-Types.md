#### Let us now see how to identify different file types in Linux.
 
One way to identify a file type is by making use of the **`file`** command. 
```
$ file /home/michael
$ flle bash-script.sh
$ file insync1000.sock
$ file /home/michael/bash-script
```

Another way to identify a file type is by making use of the **`ls -ld`** command
```
ls -ld /home/michael
ls -l basg-script.sh
```
