  - In this lecture we will learn about **Cronjobs** in Linux .


The basic usage of **cron** is to execute a job in a specific time. The **`crontab`** is a list of commands that you want to run on a regular schedule, and also the name of the command used to manage that list. **Crontab** stands for **`cron table`** because it uses the job scheduler cron to execute tasks. The schedule is called the crontab, which is also the name of the program used to edit that schedule.
