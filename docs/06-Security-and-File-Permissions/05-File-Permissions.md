  #### Modifying file permissions

  - Use **`chmod`** command to modify the file permissions.

  - Provide full access to owners

    [~]$ chmod u+rwx test-file
    ```

  - Provide Read access to Owners, groups and others, Remove execute access

    ```
    [~]$ chmod ugo+r-x test-file
    ```

  - Remove all access for others

     ```
     [~]$ chmod o-rwx test-file
     ```

  - Full access for Owner, add read , remove execute for group and no access for others

    ```
    [~]$ chmod u+rwx,g+r-x,o-rwx test-file
    ```
 
  - Provide full access to Owners, group and others

    ```
    [~]$ chmod 777 test-file
    ```

  - Provide Read and execute access to Owners,groups and others

    ```
    [~]$ chmod 777 test-file
