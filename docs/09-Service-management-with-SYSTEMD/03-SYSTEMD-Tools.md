# SYSTEMD Tools to Manage SYSTEMD service

  - Take me to the [Tutorial](https://kodekloud.com/courses/873064/lectures/17074645)

  In this lecture we will explore two major SYSTEMD tools:
  - SYSTEMCTL
  - JOURNALCTL

  ## SYSTEMCTL

   - __Systemctl__ is the main command used to manage services on a **`SYSTEMD`** managed server.
   - It can be used to manage services such as **`START/STOP/RESTART/RELOAD`** as well as **`ENABLE/DISABLE`** services
     during the system boot.
   - It is also used to **`LIST AND MANAGE UNITS`** and **`LIST AND UPDATE TARGETS`**

    ### Systemctl Commands 

    - To start a service use the start command, for example to start a docker service use **`systemctl start docker`**
    
      ```
      [~]$ systemctl start docker
      ```

    - To stop a service use the stop command, for example to stop a docker service use **`systemctl stop docker`**
    
      ```
      [~]$ systemctl stop docker
      ```
    - To restart a service use the restart command, for example to restart a docker service use **`systemctl restart  docker`** this will stop and start again.

      ```
      [~]$ systemctl restart docker
      ```
    - To reload a service use the reload command, for example to reload a docker service use **`systemctl reload docker`**, this will reload all the configuration without interrupting the normal functionaltiy of the service
    
      ```
      [~]$ systemctl reload docker
      ```
    - To enable a service and make it persistent accross reboots use the enable command, for example to enable a docker service use **`systemctl enable docker`**
      
      ```
      [~]$ systemctl enable docker
      ```

    - To disable a service at boot use the disable command, for example to disable a docker service use **`systemctl disable docker`** command.
      
      ```
      [~]$ systemctl disable docker
      ```

    - To know the status of the service use **`systemctl status docker`** command. This command provided the state of the service. If running properly is should show **`active (running)`** state as shown in screenshot below.
    
      ```
      [~]$ systemctl status docker
      ```

    - Besides **`active (running)`** state there are few other state that you should be aware off.

    - Running **`systemctl daemon reload`** command after making changes to service unit file reloads the system manager configuration and makes the systemd aware of the changes. 

    - To edit the service file use command **`systemctl edit project-mercury.service --full`** this will open a text editor, you can make the changes and re-write the settings as needed, making changing this way applied immediately without running the **`systemctl daemon reload`** command
      
      ```
      [~]$ systemctl daemon-reload
      ```
      ```
      [~]$ systemctl edit project-mercury.service --full
      ```
    - To see the current runlevel use **`systemctl get-default`**
      
      ```
      [~]$ systemctl get default
      ```

    - To change the runleve to a different target use  **`systemctl set-default multi-user.target`**
      
      ```
      [~]$ systemctl set-default multi-user.target
      ```

    - To list all the units that systemd has loaded use **`systemctl list-units --all`**, this lists all the unit which are active, inactive or anyother state.
      
      ```
      [~]$ systemctl list-units --all
      ```

    - To list only active units use **`systemctl list-units`** command
      
      ```
      [~]$ systemctl list-units
      ```
        

  ## JOURNALCTL

   - __Journalctl__ is a command for quering/viewing logs collected by systemd.
   - The systemd-journald service is responsible for systemdâ€™s log collection, and it retrieves messages from the kernel    systemd services, and other sources.
   - Very useful when you are troubleshooting issues with systemd services.
     
      ![Journalctl](../../images/journalctl.png)

   - Using **`journalctl`** commands print all the log entries from oldest to the newest.
   - Using **`journalctl -b`** command print all the logs from the current boot.
   - Using **`journalctl -u docker.service`** command print all the logs specific to the unit specified, for example docker in this case.

      ```
      [~]$ journalctl
      ```

      ```
      [~]$ journalctl -b
      ```      

      ```
      [~]$ journalctl -u docker.service 
      ```
