# Switching & Routing 

  - Take me to the [Tutorial](https://kodekloud.com/courses/873064/lectures/17074531)

  #### Switching

  - Switching helps to connect the interface within same network.

  - To see the interfaces on the hosts use **`ip link`** command

  ```
  [~]$ ip link
  eth0: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 1500 qdisc fq_codel state UP mode
  DEFAULT group default qlen 1000
  ```

  -  To connect to the switch we use **`ip addr add`** command

  ```
  [~]$ ip addr add 192.168.1.10/24 dev eth0
  ```

  #### Routing

  - Router helps to connect to two seprate networks together.

  - To see the existing routing table configuration run the **`route`** command.

  ```
  [~]$ route
  Kernel IP routing table
  Destination Gateway Genmask Flags Metric Ref Use Iface
  ```

  - To configure a gateway on system B to reach the system on other network run

  ```
  [~]$ ip route add 192.168.2.0/24 via 192.168.1.1
  ```
  
  ```
  [~]$ route
  
  Kernel IP routing table
  Destination Gateway Genmask Flags Metric Ref Use Iface
  192.168.2.0 192.168.1.1 255.255.255.0 UG 0 0 0 eth0
  ```

  - To see the ip addresses assign to interfaces use

  ```
  [~]$ ip addr
  ```

  - 

  ```
  [~]$ ip route
  ```

  - To make this changes permanent you must set them in **`/etc/network/interfaces`** file.
