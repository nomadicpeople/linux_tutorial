# Switching & Routing 

 #### Switching

Switches are used to connect multiple devices on the same network within a building or campus. For example, a switch can connect your computers, printers and servers, creating a network of shared resources. The switch would serve as a controller, allowing the various devices to share information and talk to each other. Through information sharing and resource allocation, switches save you money and increase productivity.

- connecting to the gateway server from a machine inside of the network. Suppose we have a server A that is a part of Network 1. The server is configured to accept connection requests from machines that do not belong to Network 1. It is also configured to ingnore/reject all requests coming from machines belonging to Network 1. Thus if we have a machine B, that belong to network 1, it will be automatically ignored
- passing as ssh tunnel. 
 

A network can be also divided into subnetworks. For example a campus network can be divided into virtual LANs, such that computers contected to the virtual LAN cannot see the rest of the netwoork. Useful for security purposes.

  #### Routing

Routers are used to tie multiple networks together. For example, you would use a router to connect your networked computers to the Internet and thereby share an Internet connection among many users. The router will act as a dispatcher, choosing the best route for your information to travel so that you receive it quickly.

Routers analyze the data being sent over a network, change how it is packaged and send it to another network or over a different type of network. They connect your business to the outside world, protect your information from security threats, and can even decide which computers get priority over others.
