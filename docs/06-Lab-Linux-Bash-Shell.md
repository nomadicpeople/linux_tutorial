   ```
3. What is the value of the environment variable **`TERM`**
   ```
   echo $TERM

   echo export PROJECT=MERCURY >> ~/.profile
   ```
5. Which of the following directories is not part of the PATH variable?
   ```
   /opt/caleston-code
   ```
6. Set an alias called **`up`** for the command **`uptime`** and make it persistent by adding to **`~/.profile`** file.
   ```
   echo alias up=uptime >> ~/.profile
   ```
7. Update Bob's prompt so that it displays the date as per the format below:

Make sure the change is made persistent.

   echo 'PS1=[\d]\u@\h:\w$' >> ~/.profile
   ```
