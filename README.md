# The ISSAI Guidebook on Basics of Linux and Networking

Most of the content provided below is adapted from the notes for [Linux Basics Course](https://github.com/kodekloudhub/linux-basics-course) hosted on KodeKloud. We refer you to their Github repository if you would like to explore the full version of the course.

### How to use this guidebook?
The compiled material represents the necessary package of knowledge required for an ISSAI researcher.  We recommend to go through the sections in the incremetal order, one by one.

How to start?
- If you own a Windows machine, please start with [Section-0.1](docs/00-Setup/01-Setup-Windows.md) to install Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL), and then launch the WSL terminal and proceed with [Section-0.2](docs/00-Setup/02-Remote-Connect.md). 
- If you are a Linux user, begin with [Section-0.2](docs/00-Setup/02-Remote-Connect.md). 
- If you have an Apple computer, use the default terminal. macOS supports all standard UNIX commands. In practice, most common LINUX commands are suitable for Mac. But if you have access to a remote Linux server/machine, please connect to it and then proceed with [Section-0.2](docs/00-Setup/02-Remote-Connect.md).
