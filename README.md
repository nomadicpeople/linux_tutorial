- If you own a Windows machine, please start with chapter 0 to install Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL), and then launch the WSL terminal and proceed with Chapter 1. 
- If you are a Linux user, begin with section 2 of chapter 0. 
- If you have an Apple computer, use the default terminal. macOS supports all standard UNIX commands. In practice, most common LINUX commands are suitable for Mac. But if you have access to a remote Linux server/machine, please connect to it and then proceed with section 2 of chapter 0.
